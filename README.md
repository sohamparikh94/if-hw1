This game contains different rooms along with a garden inside a single house. To win, you need to leave from the house dressed as a guard (with a spear and wearing an armor) so that you can leave the house unidentified. The game starts with the player in the bedroom, where there is also a jug. There is a garden has magical plants which help navigate in toxic environments without killing the player. They are withered and need to be watered. To water the plants, you need the jug to be full of water and it can be filled from the kitchen. The spear is in the attic, which is completely dark and needs a torch. The torch is instead in the basement which is full of a toxic, pungent gas. The basement also connects to an armor room, which contains the armor inside a glass case. The glass case needs to be broken and that can only be done so using the spear.

This game is inspired from different games and movies (the names of which I cannot remember) about how spies and informants usually dress as one of the guards to escape from a crime scene. I picked this topic because these stories have always fascinated me and I thought it would be a good idea to get the player to complete different tasks inspired by mystery rooms in order to escape the place unidentified.
